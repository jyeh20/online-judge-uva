Public repository for my solutions to ICPC problems found on <a href="https://onlinejudge.org">Online Judge</a>.

The `/in` folder contains `.in` text files of Sample Input.

The `/out` folder contains `.out` text files of Sample Output.

To test a solution, run the following script (replace the `#` with the problem number you would like to check):

```
python3 {#}.py < ./in/{#}.in | diff - ./out/{#}.out
```
